# Customer Site Validation Rules (v1.1)

**Created:** January 7, 2026
**Branch:** v1.1
**Purpose:** Systematic validation of customer.quadframe.work

---

## Golden Rules

1. **Every page change requires explicit approval** - No autonomous decisions
2. **Go page by page, section by section** - Systematic review
3. **Show before changing** - Present current content, wait for approval
4. **No assumptions** - Ask if unclear

---

## Validation Process

### For Each Page:
1. Show current sections/content
2. Wait for user feedback on each section
3. Only make changes after explicit approval
4. Confirm changes before moving to next section

### For Each Change:
1. Show exactly what will be changed (old → new)
2. Wait for "yes" or approval
3. Make the change
4. Confirm completion
