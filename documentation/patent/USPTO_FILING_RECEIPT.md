```

**Where to add:**

```markdown
# Patent Notice

QUAD Platform is protected by:
- U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/956,810
- Filing Date: January 9, 2026
- Status: Patent Pending

This patent covers the following innovations:
- Pre-generation compliance enforcement for AI code generation
- Meta-AI architecture with restricted context (zero hallucination)
- Progressive enforcement levels (alpha/beta/production)
- Multi-agent cost-optimized code generation
- QUAD Language domain-specific programming language

Unauthorized use, reproduction, or implementation of the patented
inventions may result in patent infringement liability.
```

### 3. Preserve Evidence of Invention Date

**Create "Prior Art Package" (Protects You Later):**

- ✅ Git commit history (shows development timeline)
- ✅ Demo videos (shows working implementation)
- ✅ Customer testimonials (shows real-world use)
- ✅ Blog posts / documentation (shows public disclosure)
- ✅ Conference presentations (shows thought leadership)

**Why this matters:** If competitor challenges your patent, you can prove you invented it first.

### 4. Start Building QUAD Platform

**Establish commercial use before filing non-provisional:**

- ✅ Deploy alpha version
- ✅ Get beta customers (even if free)
- ✅ Collect usage data
- ✅ Document compliance violations prevented
- ✅ Show 0% hallucination rate vs 30-40% baseline

**Why:** Non-provisional patent is stronger with proven commercial use.
