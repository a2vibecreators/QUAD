## Overview

The **Meeting Agent** manages team meetings end-to-end: scheduling, minute-taking, action item tracking, and follow-up automation. It transforms meetings from time-consuming interruptions into valuable decision-making forums with automatic documentation and accountability.

### Core Capabilities

1. **Intelligent Meeting Scheduling** - Find availability, book rooms, send invites
2. **Automated Meeting Notes** - Record, transcribe, summarize key decisions
3. **Action Item Tracking** - Extract todos, assign owners, follow up
4. **Calendar Integration** - Sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, Slack
5. **Smart Meeting Analytics** - Attendance, decision quality, follow-up rates

```
📧 Email to meeting-bot@quad.example.com:
"Schedule engineering standup with @backend-team
Time: Monday 10am
Duration: 15 mins"

✅ Response:
"I've scheduled the standup:
📅 Monday, Jan 13, 2026 @ 10:00 AM

David: "I'll run QA tests today"
Alice: "Good. Bob and Carol - action item to resolve DB migration by Friday"
```

**Step 4: Minutes Generated**

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How Measured |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Minutes generation time | <5 min | Time to post after meeting ends |
| Action item completion rate | 90%+ | % of action items completed on time |
| Meeting attendance | 95%+ | People showing up on time |
| Calendar accuracy | 99%+ | Double-bookings or conflicts prevented |
| Team satisfaction | 4.5/5 | Quarterly survey |
| Time saved per week | 3 hrs | Manual note-taking + scheduling |

---

## Limitations & Scope

### What Meeting Agent Does NOT Do

- ❌ Join ad-hoc discussions (only scheduled meetings)
- ❌ Make decisions for the team (captures decisions, doesn't make them)
- ❌ Resolve conflicts (escalates to human facilitators)
- ❌ Handle highly confidential meetings (depends on org policy)
- ❌ Translate to non-English languages (future feature)

### Privacy Considerations

- 🔒 1-on-1 meetings: Can disable recording per org policy
- 🔒 PII masking: Remove sensitive data from transcripts
- 🔒 Retention: Delete recordings after retention period
- 🔒 Access control: Only meeting attendees see minutes

---

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Q2 2026):** MVP
- ✅ Meeting scheduling
- ✅ Auto-join & recording
- ✅ Transcription (basic)
- ✅ Action item extraction

**Phase 2 (Q3 2026):** Advanced
- Meeting insights (duration, participants, frequency)
- Action item analytics
- Multi-language support
- Advanced Jira integration

**Phase 3 (Q4 2026):** Enhancement
- AI-powered meeting insights (sentiment, engagement)
- Predictive action item completion
- Meeting health reports
- Executive dashboards
