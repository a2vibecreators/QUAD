## The "Vibe Coding" Movement

### Origin

In **February 2025**, **Andrej Karpathy** (OpenAI founder, Tesla AI Director) coined the term **"vibe coding"**:

> "Describing software in natural language and letting AI write, refine, and debug the code."

### Vibe Coding Platform Growth

| Platform | Launch | Users (Jan 2026) | Apps Created |
|----------|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Lovable** | Dec 2024 | 8M | 100K/day |
| **Bolt.new** | Oct 2024 | 5M | Millions |
| **Emergent** | Aug 2025 | 2.5M | 10K (first 2 weeks) |
| **v0.dev** | 2024 | - | Frontend components |

### Who's Using Vibe Coding

| User Type | Use Case | Platform Preference |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Founders** | MVPs, prototypes | Lovable, Bolt.new |
| **Designers** | Interactive mockups | v0.dev |
| **Product Managers** | Feature demos | Bolt.new |
| **Developers** | Boilerplate, scaffolding | All platforms |
| **Non-technical** | Internal tools | Lovable, Emergent |

### Impact on Traditional Development

```
Before Vibe Coding:
  Idea → Design → Spec → Dev (weeks) → QA → Deploy

With Vibe Coding:
  Idea → Natural language → Working app (hours)

Result:
  - 10-100x faster prototyping
  - Non-developers can build
  - Developers handle complex logic
  - New "prompt engineering" skill
```
